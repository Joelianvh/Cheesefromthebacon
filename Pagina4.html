                <h2>
                    Main strategies of the game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the time the best strategies are too try to flank your enemies without them knowing where
                    you are coming from. Sounds simple enough, but to do this you will need a lot of map and game
                    knowledge to actually pull this off succesfully. That is why most of the time the teamleaders
                    (squadleaders and commander) are poeple that have a lot of game knowledge. If you are not very
                    experienced and are not confident in your game sense, you will probably not pick up any of these
                    rolls as other experienced teamleaders will expect you to know how to handle some strategic
                    situations.

                </p>
                <p>So if you are new to the game you will most likely be instructed by your squadleader to move to
                    certain positions and shoot and engage at specific timings. </p>
                <h3>
                    Infranty squadleader strats
                </h3>
                <p>Most commen strats as a squadleader in the beginning of a match is to take a supply vehicle and setup
                    a FOB(Forward Operations Base) somewhere near a point of intrest.</p>
                <h3>
                    Armor squadleader strats
                </h3>
                <p>As a squadleader of an armor squad tou are very importaint to the succes of your team. A single armor
                    crew can change the tides in almost any battle and is therefore an essential part of any team. And
                    armor squad is a small squad of almost always 3 members. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Spotter
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Driver
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Gunner
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p> Each of these member have a very specific objective. Spotter spots enemy targets and looks for
                    potential dangers. Driver drives the vehicle and tries to get in good positions and angles for
                    the shooter to hit targets. And the shooter obviously tries to kill as many enemy targets as
                    possible. Most of the time the shooter is also the squadleader as they are the most importaint
                    and should have the most experience. </p>
                <h3>
                    Commander strats
                </h3>
                <p>The commander is a lonesome role which there is only 1 of each match per team. It is almost the
                    exact same as the infantry squadleader, but has 1 big differance. Which is its Support calls of
                    which there are 4.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        UAV
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Static Artillery Barrage
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creeping Artillery Barrage
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A-10 Warthog Airstrike
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>A-10 Warthog</h4>
                <img src="video's and gifs/gifs/ezgif.com-video-to-gif (3).gif" alt="Video of A10 destroying a Tank">
                <h4>Artillary Barrage from UAV point of view</h4>
                <img src="video's and gifs/gifs/ezgif.com-video-to-gif (2).gif" alt="POV of a UAV seeing an Artillery Barrage">
                <p>These support calls can pivot the outcome of any battle. The UAV can reveal enemy positions and
                    inplacements. The Barrage's can destroy any FOB and vehicle in seconds and whipe out entire
                    squads. The A-10 Warthog is an iconic American aircraft which is known for its pricise
                    destructive power and its icon BRRRRRRRRT sound that the main cannon makes. Mostly used to take
                    out static vehicles or implacements</p>

            <h2>Communication</h2>
            <p>communication is mostly self explanitory, Your squadleader tells you to go there or to get down and you just do as your told. But some terms that might be used when you first start playing this game are very confusing. For example;"I need the HAT's and LAT's to resupply of the FOB and take out that BMP while I get on the TOW." A lot of these words are acronyms. I'll give some of the most used examples and what they mean.</p>
            <p>As for the sentence I used as an example.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HAT</li>
                <p>means Heavy Anti Tank, and is the Kit that has the most destructive weaponry against tanks with the Tandem round. So if your squad leader ask's for a HAT or Tandem, then they are reverring to the player with that kit.</p>
                <li>LAT</li>
                <p>This is the Light Anti Tank, so the player with a "normal" rocket launcher round.</p>
                <li>FOB and HAB</li>
                <p>A lot of poeple confuse these 2 terms. FOB is a Forward Operating Base and is looks like a radio station like this image below. The HAB is Hesco Armored Base, and is the spawnpoint created within the radius of a FOB. </p>
                <img src="images/FOB.webp" alt="Image of the FOB radio">
                <img src="images/HAB.webp" alt="Image of the HAB">
                <li>TOW or ATGM or Kornet</li>
                <p>This stands for Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wire-guided. And is and emplacement capable of launching a Big rocket meant for the destruction of hostile vehicles</p>
